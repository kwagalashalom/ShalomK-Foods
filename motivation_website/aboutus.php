                <p>
                    Am just an ordinary person just like anyone else who wants to have purpose and meaning in there life<br>Who want to achieve as much as i can as long as am still alive and make a difference in peoples lives with the gift God has blessed me with.
                    <br>Am not that educated since i didn’t proceed for further education after high school because i never had funds, hustling has been the order of the day from my young age because to survive you had to work hard to support my self because my family didn’t have enough to provide when i needed it. This made me to thinks big, wiser and outside the box since survival was only for the fitt,est, my dream was to live a better life but i know to achieve it there had a price to pay and i was ready to encounter whatever could come in my way, surely i have encountered them as i anticipated and that is why they have had less damage on me however serious it could appear to be,
Failing is not new to me, it has been around me at all time and those lost hope before i did, one may ask how i managed to keep upset with the endless falling and the answer is simple, Rising everytime i fall is the only weapon hold in one arm and the other hand i protect myself with the belief as my sheild from doubt, hopelessness and fear
