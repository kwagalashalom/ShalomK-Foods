                    Am just an ordinary person just like anyone else who wants to have purpose and meaning in there life<br>Who want to achieve as much as i can as long as am still alive and make a difference in peoples lives with the gift God has blessed me with.
                    <br>Am not that educated since i didn’t proceed for further education after high school because i never had funds, hustling has been the order of the day from my young age because to survive you had to work hard to support my self because my family didn’t have enough to provide when i needed it. This made me to thinks big, wiser and outside the box since survival was only for the fitt,est, my dream was to live a better life but i know to achieve it there had a price to pay and i was ready to encounter whatever could come in my way, surely i have encountered them as i anticipated and that is why they have had less damage on me however serious it could appear to be,
Failing is not new to me, it has been around me at all time and those lost hope before i did, one may ask how i managed to keep upset with the endless falling and the answer is simple, Rising everytime i fall is the only weapon hold in one arm and the other hand i protect myself with the belief as my sheild from doubt, hopelessness and fear

                    <b>Fulfilment of our obligation:<br></b>it has been our duty to do what we are doing and be what we are now from day one, this means we are not here by accident, its through lots of expected and non expected circumstances, commitment and resilience that we have been able to make it to this point, Ladies and gentlemen,its our duty to help you claim for what was ment to be yours<br><br>
                    <b>Integrity:</b><br>Being honest To yourself and people around you is important, this creats belief, un doubted,un divideded soul with in you to enable you accomplish your goals, by sticking to your moral principles and what is rightful is also another which has helped me to overcome what many couldn’t and so you too can follow the same or even something better than mine as long as its right and taking you in the right direction.<br><br>
                    <b>Respect:</b><br>It will always start with yourself, if one doesn't respect himself, it won't be easy to respect others hence won’t be respected not even deserve the right to complain if disrespected, generally, respect has no defined amount of age or category of people to be respected and not to be respected, be it young or old, men or women, black or white, rich or poor, it should be on a balanced scale, its quite tricky that some times we have to respect those with ideas different from yours, meaning that at times respect is more of a self control habit, when respect people life becomes much more easier because you’ll have a wide range of people to give you a hand including those whom you have differences with in some areas.<br><br>
                    <b>Responsibility:</b><br>There’s alot of things which can take your focuse from something meaningful, oftenly the are external forces however at times it could be internal,  but whichever side it comes from, it should not drive you from the direction your heading to, you should be accountable and responsible for each hour, day, week, month and each year of your life, this has helped me learn from the bad times of my life and had some happy moments as well but most of my happy moments come when i look back where am from, i end up having tears of joy, implying that for each situation we encounter, consider yourself accountable because it could be a stepping  to where you are going.<br><br>
                    <b>Open mindedness:</b><br>In life, we all wish for the best, but to have it, you must see good in good and good in bad, the scriptures say that when one door is closed there more doors that are opened, anyone with an open mind should not focus on the closed it but instead focus on finding open doors, don't focus on problems instead focus on solutions, not focus on failing instead focus on winning, an open minded person doesn’t focus on what he was yesterday but instead focuses on what he will be tomorrow, i came to learn that failing is the biggest obstractor of mankind and it takes a positive and open minded mind to overcome it, everyone has this possibility but few manage to use it<br><br>
                    <b>Consistincy:</b><br>Life is full of challenges and obstacles, meaning that staying on course becomes tricky, at times they take you off road and it your responsibility to get back on the road,, being consistent doesn’t mean that you dont encounter setbacks or forces which pull you back but rather to crawl or walk ahead even when odds are not in favor,  spearing an hour or two for something important is worth a while, you don't need 24hours a day to be considered consistent, all you need is an hour or two but on a daily basis, after a period of a year you’ll have developed something great, i faced a lot of challenges at work and in my daily life but i never left a pen and paper behind, everytime i thought of something, i could wright it down immidetly because i had less free time at work and after work but i'd wake up ealry in the morning to atleast spend two or three hours reading or writing something everyday, its those few hours or minutes which count, when you do the same thing on a daily basis it becomes a habit and in a long run run it turns into a character, time came when i never needed an alerm to wake up at 5:00 o’clock in the morning, consistency is built, join us to built yours<br><br>

              1.	The main purpose of World of determination is to rise fallen hopes and spirits in people who’ve lost it , Everyone has a dream to look upto and Everyone has a goal to achieve,  fortunately, few make it to what they dreamt or to the finish line of there goal, accomplishing something we started is the major challenge we face because everytime we fail, lets say at point C, we tend to loose hope of reaching point D, point D will appear very far away to get to, you’ll develope fear and doubts instead of courage and strength, Maya Angelou said, we may encounter many defeats but we must not be defeated, it may even be necessary to encounter defeat so that we can know who we are,  defeat will help you pick up yourself and get back up to continue and accomplish what you started, we have been there and the good news is that we are no longnews there, so can you too get out of it and make your dreams, spirit and goals live again to become what seemed to be impossible.<br>
              2.	Encourage you reach your potential ability. Nothing is impossible and nothing is too far fetched but many times we tend to limit ourselves by playing safe where its not necessary, Fear is the number one factor limiting the human race, when you fail to differentiate fear from danger you’re already in danger because it builds boundaries in your minds, creats fake illusions, imaginations to prevent you from seeing possibilities hence limiting opportunities, its our resposibility as world of determination to show you that you are different from any other race, nothing can stop you from achieving what is yours when you put in what it takes to achieve it.<br>
              3.	Make life have meaning and know the purpose of living. Many of us have the gift of life but few know the the meaning and the purpose of living, some leave to finish the remaining time on their clock, while others leave to accomplish something they’ll leave behind to be remembered for, those are one’swith purpose, those are the ones who found meaning in living, giving life or something meaning mainly is about seeing what others don't see, doing what others dont or fear to do, doing what others think and don't do <br>
